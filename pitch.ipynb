    "Many people in the world suffer from heart disease. Narrowing of blood vessels usually implies heart disease, which is related to several factors such as age, angina, blood pressure, and serum cholesterol levels. Heart problems are common in older adults due to aging arteries (Heart Health and Aging, n.d.). Coronary artery disease is a heart condition with angina. Blood pressure can reflect the health of blood vessels (High Blood Pressure Symptoms, Causes, and Problems | cdc.gov, 2021), while serum cholesterol values can also indicate potential blood flow restrictions in blood vessels (Warning Signs and Symptoms of Heart Disease, n.d.). So,\n", 
    
    "\t **What is the predictive status of vessel stenosis based on patient age, type of chest pain, resting blood pressure, and serum cholesterol values?**\n",
    
    "To answer the question, this project will conduct a classification prediction on the vessel stenosis with a random dataset *Reprocessed Hungarian* (Machine Learning Repository, 1988) which contains all the required variables above."

A visualization like this may demonstrate any relationship between chest pain type and associated resting blood pressure and cholesterol. A similar visualization might use whether or not they are likely to have heart disease as the coloring for the points, and would be useful for visualizing whether or not cholesterol and blood pressure are effective predictors of heart disease."
